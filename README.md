# KinematicModelling


Python modules used to estimate centre velocity, velocity dispersion and parallaxes for open clusters, based on Lindegren et al. (2000, http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000A%26A...356.1119L). 

One application of this version of the method can be found in Bravi et al. (2018).

## Prerequisites

The routines depend on the following python packages:
1. PyGaia
2. astropy
3. numpy, scipy;
4. emcee;
5. coner.


## Notes
The notebooks provide an example for a possible application of the routines in routines_mod.py and derivatives_mod.py.
The space motion is derived for the nearby open cluster IC 2602.

The steps of the procedure are explained in the notebooks (I hope clearly enough!).
