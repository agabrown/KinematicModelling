# KinematicModelling


Python modules used to estimate centre velocity, velocity dispersion and parallaxes for open clusters, based on Lindegren et al. (2000, http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000A%26A...356.1119L). 

One application of this version of the method can be found in Bravi et al. (2018).

## Prerequisites

The routines depend on the following python packages:
1. PyGaia
2. astropy
3. numpy, scipy;
4. emcee
5 coner.
